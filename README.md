Just got out of 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Antes del cuerpo, and man, where do I even start? There’s something about the way this 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 gets under your skin, like that stubborn strand of hair caught in your sunglasses — irritating yet kind of fitting. The theater was 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦zing, as per usual. Seriously, why do they keep these places like steaks ready to be devoured? My teeth almost rattled out of my head, but hey, worth it for the warmth of... confusion? emotion? I’m still not sure what exactly. 

The story kind of swirled around like smoke. At points, it felt like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a kid tell you about their dream, with all these bits jumping around, but there they go, catching you off guard with a look or a line that ties it all together. And speaking of that, what was with the soundscape? Almost like a cat purring and hissing at the same time. I'm into it, not gonna lie, though sometimes I wondered if I was 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 a 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 or caught in someone’s looped fever dream. Makes you wonder if I should just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later and see if any of it changes in the comfort of my non-arctic living room. 

> God, the characters. Just when you think, Yeah, okay, I get this one, they’d throw you a curveball. Like, how does someone manage to be both the anchor and the unmoored ship? If you've ever been to one of those family reunions where everyone’s acting out their unresolved issues like it’s Thanksgiving Theater, then you might get it.

There’s too much going on to really sum up, but can we talk about that scene (you know the one) where the light breaks just right, and it’s all glowy and kinda says everything without a word? Or maybe it doesn’t say anything at all and I’m just reaching. Either way, it's like someone bottled a big sigh.

```
if (mainCharacter.choices.Contains(ptr)) {
    ConsiderConsequences();
}
```

Would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again? Maybe after a nap. It’s like a meal that’s delicious but leaves you wondering what exactly you just ate. Was it a burrito? Or maybe just a fevered dream of a burrito. Anyway, it sticks. Like wet sand to your soles after a long day on duty, trying to get it all off, but realizing, eh, might as well just live with it a while. Go see it, or don’t. But maybe do.
